# ME409-SwarmRobotics
#### This course consists of reading various research papers on swarm algorithms and implementations and then mimicking them on our own in Python in the Docker environmnet

## LAB 1
* Getting used to the Docker environment through a simple orbit algorithm
* Have one robot be the central robot and the other orbit the central robot

## LAB 2
* Develop a hop count algorithm based on a past paper
* End goal is to create a global coordinate system and using this have the robots form the shape of the Northwestern 'N' using their LEDs

## LAB 3
* Develop an algorithm using the brazil nut effect to create 3 concentric rings around the center of an arena
* Approach is based off of a paper discussed in class
* The first image is with a 100 robot swarm (50 in each ring) and the second image is with a 150 robot swarm (50 in each ring)
